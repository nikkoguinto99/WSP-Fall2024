        <h1>Nicholas Guinto<br>
            Prof Plotkin<br>
            Web Server Programming<br></h1>
        <p>
            My name is Nicholas Guinto and I am a 25-year-old computer science major in my senior year at SUNY New Paltz. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with friends and my partner or playing video games on my own time. After I graduate with my bachelor’s degree I am aiming to get a career in cyber security.
            I had transferred from Rockland Community College with an associate’s degree in computer information systems. Before attending New Paltz, I had taken courses in Java, HTML/CSS, C++, and visual basic. Over the course of my education, I have completed projects and assignments in those classes including static websites, animated websites, and basic calculation applications. Outside of classes I had looked up various examples of professional portfolios and websites and used them as reference to create my own.
            After taking this course I am hoping to expand my knowledge of back-end development. I believe that this class will further assist me in building more advanced websites and getting closer to a professional career.
            I feel very comfortable in this class with both you as a professor as well as the students I surround myself with. The past few years have been difficult but I found that group settings and interactions are very supportive in times we feel like we struggle to ask for help.
